## About Me:

#### My name is Vadim, I have been doing web development for two years. I started with HTML, CSS, then learned JavaScript on a basic level, now I am rapidly learning vue.js, no commercial experience
#### My first experience with real work I received on the freelance site, where I took easy layouts, which I quickly coped with and began to look for larger orders. First order I got from friends to create a landing page
#### I believe that everything will work out!

## Code Exampe

#### As an example of my JavaScript code I will show an example from the course whose task is to output true if a character is entered into input, false if a digit

```
function t3(event) {
    console.log(event);
    let out3 = document.querySelector('.out-3');
    if (event.keyCode >= 48 && event.keyCode <= 57) {
        out3.innerHTML = true;
    }
    else {
        out3.innerHTML = false;
    }
}

document.querySelector('.i-3').onkeypress = t3;
```
